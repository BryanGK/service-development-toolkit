# Welcome

# Welcome to the Service Development Toolkit!

## Here, you'll find:

### 1. Durable components with the public sector in mind

### 2. Guidance on using components

### 3. Built-in accessibility guardrails

## Who is it for?

The toolkit was created for all kinds of teams that create digital services in the public sector. Our goal is to make the components as easy to use as possible to serve the wider and incredibly diverse public sector community.

## Accessibility is no longer a nice-to-have.

The toolkit uses *Progressive Enhancement* to help teams create sustainable, resilient, and accessible products. This makes sure that, no matter where our users are, they can always access the services they need.
