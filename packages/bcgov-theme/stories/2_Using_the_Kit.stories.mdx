# Getting Started with the Toolkit

## How to use the Toolkit

### 1. Install the toolkit

## Installing the Toolkit

1. Install the package using your preferred package manager:

- `npm i @button-inc/bcgov-theme` OR
- `yarn add @button-inc/bcgov-theme`

2. Import the components you need using the following syntax:

- `import { Button } from @button-inc/bcgov-theme` OR
- `import Button from @button-inc/bcgov-theme/Button`
- Note: *If you are only importing a few components and are concerned about bundle size, the second syntax will only import code for the individual components you are using and should be preferred. As of version 1.0.0-alpha.4, the difference between the methods for importing a single button is ~63kB.*

3. Include the component in your code

- `<Button>Click Me!</Button>`
