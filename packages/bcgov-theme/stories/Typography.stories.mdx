# Typography

The typography component is designed to be used with the [typography](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typography) npm package.
It includes base typography styles for BCGov style fonts that you can integrate to apply to your whole app. To use this style,
it depends on two other packages, the BCSans fonts and the react-typography component. First install these dependencies:

`npm i react-typography @bcgov/bc-sans`

Then create a component that can use these fonts:

```jsx
import { TypographyStyle } from 'react-typography';
import typography from '@button-inc/bcgov-theme/typography';
import '@bcgov/bc-sans/css/BCSans.css';

export default function BCGovTypography() {
  return <TypographyStyle typography={typography} />;
}
```

Adding this component to the top level of another page or the whole application will apply these fonts and styles to it. For example,

```jsx
import Typography from "components/Typography";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography />
      <Header />
      <main>
        ...
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```
