# Evaluate Existing React Component Libraries

## Background

Evaluation of existing libraries to see if there is a useful way to extend them to fit our goals. We are evaluating based on the following criteria:

- Progressive enhancement (list by component)
- Meets core components list
- Minimal css compiled
- Open source
- Supports react
- Themeable (Fully customizable css)
- Tree shaking
- Well-maintained
- In use by large companies
- Accessibility
- Typescript

## Findings

Library | Progressive Enhancement | Meets core components list | Minimal css compiled | Open source | Supports react | Theme Supported | Themeable (Fully customizable css) | Tree shaking | Well-maintained | In use by large companies | Accessibility | Typescript |
